# MT 3D inversion with a deep learning framework

Deep learning (DL) based algorithm to realize magnetotelluric (MT) 3D inversion 
* The goal of this study is to realize 3D inversion with deep learning algorithm and its practical application of magnetotelluric data, instead of traditional interative processing.

### Requirements:

* Install python 3.8/newer and anaconda packages: conda install keras, tensorflow, scikit-image, opencv, tqdm, pandas, numpy, seaborn etc libraries; also need download ModEM package for forward modelling.

### Instruction:
    1. _MD_generation.py_ is for generating datasets
    2. _forWeb_training_validation_1.py_ 
    3. updating...
Synthetic testing - TBC


A case study (coordinates are removed for copyright concern..)
